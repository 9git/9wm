9wm Version 1.2
===============


What is 9wm?
============

9wm is an X window manager which attempts to emulate the Plan 9 window
manager 8-1/2 as far as possible within the constraints imposed by X.
It provides a simple yet comfortable user interface, without garish
decorations or title-bars. Or icons.  And it's click-to-type.  This
will not appeal to everybody, but if you're not put off yet then read
on.  (And don't knock it until you've tried it.)

One major difference between 9wm and 8-1/2 is that the latter provides
windows of text with a typescript interface, and doesn't need to run a
separate program to emulate a terminal.  9wm, as an X window manager,
does require a separate program.  For better 8-1/2 emulation, you should
obtain Matthew Farrow's "9term" program <ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/matty/unicode>,
version 1.6 or later (earlier versions don't cooperate with 9wm in
implementing "hold mode").  Of course, you can run xterm under 9wm as well.


What is 9wm not?
================

9wm is not a virtual window manager.  It is not customisable to any
great extent.  It is not large and unwieldy, and doesn't use the X
toolkit.
If you want tvtwm or mwm, you know where to get them...


Where do I get it?

How do I compile/install it?
============================

Assuming your system is correctly configured, you should only need to
run make or make install.  make install.man should copy the manpage
(9wm.man) to the appropriate directory.

I (Neale) removed the xmkmf stuff,
because I feel like most people don't know what that is anymore.
It should compile without problems on Linux or *BSD,
but please let me know if you have difficulty.
If you're using a vintage OS,
you should probably use 9wm 1.1.


How do I use it?
================

The focused window has a black border.
Mouse and keyboard events go to this window.
Left click a non-focused window (white border) to focus it.

Right-click anywhere other than the focused window,
including in any non-focused window,
to bring up a menu.
All further actions are done with the right mouse button.
The menu has options for:

* New: launch a new xterm
* Reshape: select a window, draw new rectangle for its size
* Move: drag a window around
* Delete: kill (close) a window
* Hide: hide (iconify) a window

Beneath the first 5 items are a list of all hidden windows.


What if I find a bug?
=====================

Please mail all bug reports to neale@woozle.org, so
that I can incorporate fixes into the next release.  If you can
tell me how to fix it, all the better.


Known Problems/Bugs
===================

9wm tries hard to emulate rio, but isn't 100% compatible.  If
you are an experienced rio user, please be patient with it.

Some client programs do weird things.  One of these is Frame Maker.
It appears that if it has a modal dialog on the screen, then if any
of its windows are current, all keypresses are redirected to the
modal dialog.  This is not 9wm's fault -- Frame Maker is doing this.

Programs like Netscape Navigator like to put ridiculously long
icon name properties on their windows, of the form "Netscape: blah blah".
There is no way that I know of to stop netscape from doing this.  For this
reason, 9wm truncates labels at the first colon it finds.  This keeps the
button 3 menu from becoming excessively wide.  Note that with same
applications, you can use an iconName resource to set the label; this
works well for "xman", whose default icon name of "Manual Browser"
is a tad too long.

Other programs, such as the Chrome web browser, do something similar
with dashes: "blah blah - blah blah - Chromium".
For this reason, 9wm chops off everything before the rightmost dash.

Acknowledgements
================

Thanks to Rob Pike for writing the original 8-1/2 program (and
before that, mux) which inspired the writing of 9wm.

Thanks to John Mackin, whose gwm "wool code" for emulating mux
was also an inspiration: I used it (and hacked it) until I got
too frustrated with gwm's large memory requirements and lack of
speed (sorry Colas!), and decided to write a dedicated program.

Thanks to Matthew Farrow for writing 9term.

A big thanks to Dave Edmondson for adding support for
multi-screen displays.
